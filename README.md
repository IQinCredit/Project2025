Sure! Below is an example of a `README.md` file for your fishing game project on GitHub. This will include an overview of the game, instructions on how to run it, and any additional details that might be relevant to users or contributors.

# Fishing Game

Welcome to the **Fishing Game**! This is a simple but fun fishing simulation game built using **Python** and **Pygame**. The game involves fishing different types of fish, managing stamina, and progressing through various levels with increasing difficulty.

## Features

- Catch a variety of fish, ranging from common to legendary species.
- Manage your stamina while fishing and use it strategically.
- Engage in a fishing mini-game where you need to reel in fish.
- Level up as you catch fish and progress through different stages of the game.
- A narrative-driven experience where you make decisions to survive and thrive.

## Gameplay

- **Fishing Mini-Game**: Cast your line and try to catch fish by keeping the reel inside a green zone.
- **Stamina System**: Your stamina depletes as you reel in fish. Be careful, as running out of stamina means failure!
- **Fish Types**: The game features different rarities of fish:
  - **Common**: Easy to catch, low score.
  - **Uncommon**: Requires more effort, medium score.
  - **Rare**: Harder to catch, high score.
  - **Epic**: Very rare, higher score.
  - **Legendary**: Extremely rare, maximum score.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fishing-game.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. Download or create the sound files (`cast.wav`, `catch.wav`, `lose.wav`) and place them in the same directory as the script.

4. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python fishing_game.py
    ```

## Controls

- **A**: Move the reel left
- **D**: Move the reel right
- **SPACE**: Cast your fishing line
- **ESC**: Quit the game
- **M/L**: Choose between the forest or city in the story mode

## How to Play

1. Start the game by pressing **P** on the main menu.
2. Enter your name to begin your adventure.
3. Follow the story and make decisions to survive.
4. Try to catch as many fish as possible to level up and progress through the game.
5. Manage your stamina effectively by reeling in fish and regenerating stamina when idle.
6. The game ends when you either fail a level or complete all the levels.

## Game Mechanics

- **Leveling**: As you catch fish and complete levels, your score increases. Each level has a required score to proceed to the next one.
- **Fish Catching**: In the fishing mini-game, you'll need to control your reel inside a green zone to catch fish. Each fish has a different hold time based on its rarity.
- **Stamina**: Your stamina decreases each time you reel in the fish. If it runs out, you lose. Regenerate stamina by staying idle for a bit.
